# XPub Reader

The final app should be an Express.js app that can be packaged into an Umbrel app that queries your own full node.

## Roadmap

- Add support for legacy, segwit and native segwit addresses
  - Legacy xpub ==> P2PKH
  - SegWit ypub ==> P2WPKH-P2SH
  - Bech32 (Native SegWit) zpub ==> P2WPKH
- Singlesig vs multisig?
- Validation of addresses
